# 🏈🇺🇸 NFL Stats Viewer App

An interactive web app to explore and analyze NFL player statistics. Built using Streamlit, this app allows users to dive into American football data by filtering based on team, position, season, and more.

Built with:
- Python 🐍
- Streamlit 🎈
- Pandas 🧮
- Requests & BeautifulSoup 🌐 (if scraping was involved)

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic filters to explore NFL player stats
- Supports multiple seasons and team views
- Downloadable custom datasets
- Clean, responsive layout using Streamlit

## 📘 Dataset
Sourced via scraping from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) or pre-cleaned CSV files.

presently scraping poses a problem because the bot is actively blocking web scraping attempts, even if we use the fast api set up!

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
This project helped reinforce:
- Working with sports datasets
- Streamlit form interactions and filtering logic
- Real-world dashboard creation workflow
